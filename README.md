# Atlq_Hardware

Introduction:
 Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of India's leading computer hardware producers and has well-established operations in other countries too. However, the management noticed that they did not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director, wanted to hire someone good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct an SQL challenge, which will help him understand both skills.
 To showcase my SQL skills and demonstrate my ability to extract valuable insights from data, I undertook this challenging project.
 The company's data, while imaginary, mimics real-world datasets and provides a realistic setting to apply SQL techniques and solutions. Through this project, I aimed not only to sharpen my SQL skills but also to highlight how SQL proficiency can be a valuable asset in decision-making for businesses, whether real or fictional.

 
Project Objectives:
 Before diving into the technical aspects of the project, it's essential to understand its goals. The Atliq Hardware SQL Resume Project had several key objectives:
Data Exploration: To thoroughly examine the provided dataset and understand its contents, including tables, relationships, and data types.
Data Analysis: To perform a series of SQL queries that answer critical business questions, such as sales trends and popular products.
